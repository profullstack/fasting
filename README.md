```bash
fasting setup
```

## Setup (Development)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Link for global CLI access (optional):
```bash
pnpm link --global
```

2. Configure OpenAI API key, unit system, timezone, and user profile:
```bash

## How It Works

### Fast Tracking
The app tracks your intermittent fasting periods:

1. **Start a fast** - Records timestamp and creates an active fast entry
2. **End a fast** - Calculates duration and stores completed fast data
3. **Custom timing** - Specify exact start/end times for accurate tracking
4. **History & stats** - View all past fasts with duration analysis

### Unit System Support
Comprehensive imperial and metric unit support:

1. **Automatic detection** - Recognizes unit types (weight, volume) and systems (imperial, metric)
2. **Smart conversion** - Converts between units automatically (lbs ‚Üî kg, oz ‚Üî ml, etc.)
3. **User preferences** - Configure your preferred unit system during setup
4. **Flexible input** - Accept various formats ("500ml", "16oz", "2 cups", "1.5 hours")
5. **AI integration** - Provides unit-aware prompts to AI for better estimates

### Timezone Support
Accurate timezone handling for proper date calculations:

1. **Timezone awareness** - All timestamps are stored using your configured timezone
2. **Today's data** - "Today's" meals, exercises, and summaries respect your local timezone
3. **Flexible configuration** - Choose from common timezones or specify custom ones
4. **Automatic detection** - Defaults to your system timezone if not configured
5. **Cross-timezone consistency** - Maintains accurate data even when traveling

### User Profile & Personalization
Comprehensive user profile management for personalized recommendations:

1. **Activity Level**: Set your activity level (sedentary, moderate, active) to get appropriate calorie and exercise recommendations
2. **Medical Conditions**: Add conditions like "high blood pressure" or "diabetes" for health-conscious recommendations
3. **Personalized AI**: All OpenAI calls include your profile for tailored suggestions
4. **Smart Recommendations**: Meal, exercise, and drink suggestions consider your health profile and activity level
5. **Profile Management**: Easy commands to view, update, and manage your profile settings

### Calorie Estimation
Automatic calorie estimation using OpenAI's GPT-4o model with personalized context:

1. The description (and optional size) is sent to OpenAI's API with unit system and user profile context
2. The AI estimates calories based on your activity level, medical conditions, and specified portion size
3. Size parsing handles both imperial and metric measurements automatically
4. Personalized estimates consider your health profile for appropriate portion sizing
5. You can specify portion sizes with `--size` for more accurate estimates
6. You can still manually override with the `-c` flag if needed

### AI-Powered Personalized Recommendations
Comprehensive recommendation system for meals, exercises, and drinks based on your profile:

1. **Profile-aware analysis** - Considers your activity level, medical conditions, fasting status, recent meals, weight, and history
2. **Multi-type recommendations** - Get suggestions for meals, exercises, or drinks based on your needs
3. **Health-conscious suggestions** - Recommendations consider medical conditions for heart-healthy, diabetic-friendly options
4. **Activity-appropriate content** - Exercise intensity and meal portions matched to your activity level
5. **Unit-aware portions** - All measurements provided in your configured unit system
6. **Personalized advice** - Includes tailored advice based on your health profile and goals
7. **Fallback support** - Works even without OpenAI API key with sensible default recommendations

**Recommendation Features:**
- **Health profile integration**: Activity level and medical conditions inform all suggestions
- **Contextual awareness**: Knows if you're fasting, your recent meals, exercises, and intake
- **Multi-category support**: Meals ("sandwiches", "salads"), exercises ("cardio", "strength"), drinks ("smoothies", "teas")
- **Advanced filtering**: Calorie targets, dietary restrictions, exercise intensity, equipment availability
- **Rich information**: Includes prep time, ingredients, nutrition notes, exercise instructions, and safety tips
- **Beautiful formatting**: Well-structured output with clear sections and helpful tips

### Visual Charts
- **Weight trends** - ASCII line charts showing weight changes over time
- **Fast durations** - Bar charts displaying recent fast lengths vs. 16h target
- **Daily calories** - Line charts showing calorie intake trends over time with averages
- **Exercise calories** - Line charts showing daily calories burned through exercise
- **Comprehensive summary** - All-in-one dashboard with current fast status, today's meals, exercises, statistics, and charts

### Exercise Tracking
The app estimates calories burned using OpenAI's GPT-4o model with personalized context:

1. **Log exercise** - Provide exercise description and duration in minutes
2. **Personalized AI estimation** - Uses your activity level, medical conditions, weight, and exercise details for accurate calorie burn calculation
3. **Health-aware recommendations** - Exercise suggestions consider your medical conditions for safe, appropriate workouts
4. **Activity-matched intensity** - Recommendations match your current activity level for progressive fitness
5. **Manual override** - Use `-c` flag to specify exact calories burned if needed
6. **Daily tracking** - View total calories burned per day with trend analysis

### Cloud Storage with Supabase
The app supports optional cloud storage using Supabase for data synchronization across devices:

1. **Setup** - Run `fasting setup --supabase` to configure cloud storage
2. **Automatic sync** - All data (meals, exercises, weight, fasts) stored in Supabase
3. **Cross-device access** - Access your data from multiple devices with the same configuration
4. **Local fallback** - Switch back to local storage anytime with `fasting setup --local`

**Required Supabase Configuration:**
- Supabase URL
- Service Role Key

**Environment Variables (optional):**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
FASTING_STORAGE_MODE=supabase  # or 'local'
```

### Size Examples

**Imperial System:**
- **Drinks**: "32oz", "16oz", "8oz", "2 cups", "1 pint", "1 quart"
- **Meals**: "6oz", "8oz", "1lb", "2 slices", "large portion", "small bowl", "1 cup"

**Metric System:**
- **Drinks**: "500ml", "250ml", "1l", "1.5l"
- **Meals**: "150g", "250g", "500g", "1kg", "large portion", "small bowl"

**Duration Examples:**
- **Minutes**: "30", "45", "30 minutes", "45min"
- **Hours**: "1.5 hours", "2h", "1 hour 30 minutes"

**Weight Examples:**
- **Imperial**: "200lbs", "12oz", "2lbs"
- **Metric**: "90kg", "500g", "1.5kg"

### Configuration & Data Management

The app stores all data in `~/.config/fasting/` for secure, persistent access:

- **Configuration**: Run `fasting setup` to configure or update your API key
- **Data Storage**: All meals, drinks, and weight data are stored locally
- **Data Export**: Use `fasting export` to create a backup zip file at `~/fasting.zip`
- **Data Restore**: Extract the zip file with `unzip ~/fasting.zip -d ~` to restore data
- **Environment Variable**: You can use `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an alternative (takes precedence)
- **Clean Data**: Use `fasting clean` to delete meals/weight data
- **Full Reset**: Use `fasting clean --config` to delete everything including API key

### Clean Command Options

```bash
# Delete meals, weight, and fast data (keeps API key)
fasting clean

# Delete everything including API key configuration
fasting clean --config
```

If the OpenAI API is unavailable, the app falls back to default estimates (200 calories for meals, 50 for drinks).

- **12 test files** with **85+ total tests**
- **100% pass rate** with comprehensive error handling validation
- **Isolated testing environment** - Uses temporary directories to avoid interfering with real user data
- **Integration testing** - Validates system consistency and cross-module functionality

All tests use isolated temporary directories to avoid interfering with real user data.

### Git Pre-commit Hook

The project includes a git pre-commit hook that runs syntax checks before allowing commits:

```bash
# The hook runs automatically on git commit
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# To manually run the pre-commit check
pnpm run pre-commit
```

The pre-commit hook performs:
- **Full test suite** - Runs all unit tests to ensure code quality
- **Comprehensive validation** - Tests all functionality including async operations, storage, and charts
- **Quality assurance** - Prevents broken code from being committed

To bypass the pre-commit hook (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

### Examples

The project includes example scripts demonstrating usage:

```bash
# Run CLI usage example
pnpm example

# Run API usage example
pnpm example:api
```

**Example Files:**
- [`examples/basic-usage.js`](examples/basic-usage.js) - Demonstrates CLI commands and workflow
- [`examples/api-usage.js`](examples/api-usage.js) - Shows programmatic Node.js module usage

## Publishing

### Version Bumping

```bash
# Patch version (bug fixes): 1.0.2 -> 1.0.3
pnpm version patch
